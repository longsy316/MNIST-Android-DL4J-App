<h3>Android app which can identify hand written (single) digits.</h3>
<ul>
<ol>The app is built in Java using Deeplearning4j library. The model is a 3 layer convolutional neural network which detects digits with ~98% accuracy.</ol>
<ol>The model is trained on MNIST standard dataset and saved to disk.</ol>
<ol>Inferencing is done by loading the saved model (from internal storage, ~3MB in size) everytime the app is started. </ol>
</ul>
